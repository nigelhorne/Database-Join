# DO NOT COMMIT without completing the TODO sections.
#
# HIGH/MEDIUM difficulty survivors have TODO stubs — these need real tests.
# LOW difficulty survivors appear as comment hints — worth improving.
#
# Stubs call new() for modules with a constructor, or show a class method
# placeholder for modules without one. Add arguments as needed.
